# Images Folder

This folder is for storing images used in the Jasper Schools website.

## How to Use

1. Upload your images to this folder
2. Reference them in your code using `/images/filename.jpg`

## Example

If you upload a file named `students.jpg` to this folder, you can use it in your code like this:

```jsx
<Image
  src="/images/students.jpg"
  alt="Students"
  width={800}
  height={600}
/>
```

or with the HTML img tag:

```html
<img src="/images/students.jpg" alt="Students" />
```

## Recommended Image Sizes

- Hero images: 1920x1080px or larger
- Section images: 1200x800px
- Thumbnails: 400x300px

## Image Format Recommendations

- Use `.jpg` or `.webp` for photographs
- Use `.png` for images with transparency
- Optimize images before uploading to keep file sizes small
